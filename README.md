# Info

This is a simple calculator program. This program has been improved and re-writeen. I have used list to implement the stack and now it can also handle floating points. Some corner cases are ignored for now.

# Installation
For installing the code, you can use `git clone`
```bash
    $ cd ~
    $ git clone github.com/Raihan-28011/Basical.git
```
You can also install the files directly from github.

# How to run?

You can run the calculator, using this command:
```bash
    $ cd Basical   # change directory to the project directory
    $ bin/basical  # run this command
```
Or,
```bash
    $ cd Basical
    $ cd bin/
    $ ./basical
```
Or if you want to build the code yourself than you can do something like this,
```bash
	$ cd Basical
	$ make clean
	$ make basical
	$ make run
```
